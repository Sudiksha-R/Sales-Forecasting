# 📊 Sales Forecasting Project

## Project Overview


This project utilizes **machine learning** techniques to **forecast sales** based on historical data. The goal is to develop a predictive model using **Ridge Regression, Lasso, and Linear Regression** to analyze sales trends and make informed business decisions.

## Installation

**Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sales-forecasting.git
cd sales-forecasting
```

**Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

---

## Dataset

- The dataset used for training is **`Train.csv`**.
- Ensure the dataset is placed inside the **`data/`** directory.
- The dataset contains features such as **store location, item type, sales history, and more**.

---

## Usage

### Run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook PRJ Sales Forecasting.ipynb
```

### Run as a Python Script:
```bash
python sales_forecasting.py
```

## Key Code Implementation

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import os
import warnings
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')
from matplotlib.pylab import rcParams
rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 15, 6


dt = pd.read_csv('Train.csv')
display (dt.head())


print (dt.shape)
```

## Future Improvements

🔹 Implement **hyperparameter tuning** for better model accuracy  
🔹 Deploy as a **Flask/Streamlit Web App** for interactive forecasting  
🔹 Explore **deep learning models (LSTMs/GRUs)** for time-series forecasting
